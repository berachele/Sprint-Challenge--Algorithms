## Exercise I

a) 


b)


c) O(n log n) becuase this is a recursive function. We do not know the length of 'bunnies', however, if the number of bunnies is a lower data number, then we can assume that it is still going to run pretty fast. But, the larger the number of bunnies grows, it will be harder for the computer to run in the same speed. It will be slowed down because it needs to process however many of the bunnies we have. 10 bunnies will be fast. 100,000+ bunnies is a diferent story though.
